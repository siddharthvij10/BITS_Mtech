# Dog Breed Image Classification Project - Continuation of Session 4

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying dog breeds using a Kaggle dataset. It includes creating a DataModule, training and evaluating a model, running inference on new images, and using Docker for reproducibility.

**Tasks in this session:**
- Implement `eval.py` with its configuration to test the model using a checkpoint.
- Integrate `infer.py` from the previous session with Hydra.
- Achieve at least 70% code coverage using Codecov.
- Push the Docker image to GHCR and ensure it appears in the **Packages** section of the repository.
